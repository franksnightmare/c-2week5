The copy generic algorithm copies a series of elements (the range of
the iterator) to an output range (destination). In the example a series of elements are copied to a vector
with an existing element already in it. The for_each algorithm is not prefereed, because it needs a function
to perform the copy operation. The copy algorithm does it in 1 line of code, so is strongly preferred over the
for_each algorithm.

The for_each generic algorithm passes a series of elements (the range
of the iterator) as reference to a function that may modify the
series of elements. The copy algorithm is unable to modify the elements, so for_each must be used.
